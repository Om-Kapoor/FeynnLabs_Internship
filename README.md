Intelli-Cart is an intelligent recommender system designed to enhance the shopping experience in the retail and e-commerce sectors. Using advanced machine learning algorithms, it analyses various data points including customer behaviour, purchase history, and product preferences to provide personalised product recommendations. At its core, Intelli-Cart uses classification models to understand customers' shopping habits, preferences, and past purchases. This information is used to classify customers and suggest products that best meet their needs and wants. Regression models are employed to predict future buying behaviour, helping to anticipate what products a customer might be interested in next. This predictive ability allows for proactive customer engagement, with personalized recommendations sent via email, app notifications, or displayed during online or in-store shopping. This can be further paired with computer vision AI technologies to help recognize the customers in retail stores and based on the identified human aspects can give personalized item choice lists to the customers. Finally, this business model can help in increased sales through personalized marketing, improved customer engagement and satisfaction, insightful analytics for business decision-making, and scalable and adaptability to different retail and e-commerce scenarios.
